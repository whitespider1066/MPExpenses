# MP Expenses Project
## by Darren Christie

This project uses a Jupyter notebook to analyse an MP's expenses claims from April 2010 - March 2020.

The project folder contains this README.md file and the projects juypter notebooks.

The data folder contains two sub folders, processed and raw.
Processed contains a csv file that is the combined csv files from the raw folder once the command is ran to generate the combined file.
The processed folder also contains the MP Salary csv file that is generated by running the MP Expenses Web Scrape notebook.
Raw contains multiple csv files. One for each tax year since 2010 to 2020. These were downloaded from the IPSA website.
