# MP Expenses Project
## by Darren Christie

This project uses a Jupyter notebook to analyse an MP's expenses claims from May 2010 - April 2020.

The project folder contains this README.md file and the projects juypter notebook.

The data folder contains two sub folders, processed and raw.
Processed contans a single csv file that is the combined csv files from the raw folder.
Raw contains multiple csv files. One for each tax year since 2010 to 2020. These were downloaded from the IPSA website.
